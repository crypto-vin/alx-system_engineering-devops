# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:

### Duration: 
November 1, 2023, 09:00 AM - November 1, 2023, 12:30 PM (UTC)

### Impact: 
The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, affecting 20% of users. Users were unable to log in, leading to a significant disruption in service.

### Root Cause: 
An unexpected surge in traffic overwhelmed the authentication service, causing it to exhaust available resources and resulting in a service crash.

#### Timeline:

09:00 AM: Issue detected through a spike in error rates on the authentication service.
09:15 AM: Monitoring alerts triggered, indicating a significant increase in failed login attempts.
09:30 AM: Investigation initiated to identify the cause of the sudden surge in traffic.
10:00 AM: Initially assumed a DDoS attack due to the abnormal traffic patterns. Network and firewall configurations reviewed.
10:45 AM: No evidence of a DDoS attack found. Shifted focus to internal system issues.
11:15 AM: Discovered a memory leak in the authentication service. Incorrectly assumed it to be the primary cause of the issue.
11:45 AM: Incident escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis.
12:00 PM: Root cause identified: Unoptimized database queries during authentication were leading to a resource-intensive process.
12:30 PM: Implemented a temporary fix by optimizing the database queries to stabilize the service. Normalized traffic patterns observed, and service fully restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:

### Root Cause: 
Unoptimized database queries during authentication were causing a memory leak, leading to a resource exhaustion and subsequent service crash.

### Resolution: 
Implemented immediate optimizations on database queries to reduce resource consumption. Long-term solution involves a comprehensive review and rewrite of the authentication service to handle traffic spikes more efficiently.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

### Improvements/Fixes:
Conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase for potential optimization opportunities.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal traffic patterns and resource usage.
Implement load testing procedures to simulate and prepare for traffic spikes.

### Tasks:
Optimize database queries and implement query caching.
Integrate additional monitoring on resource utilization.
Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for process improvement.
Establish a communication plan for quicker escalation and resolution in future incidents.
This postmortem underscores the importance of swift detection, accurate diagnosis, and collaborative resolution during service outages. By addressing the root cause and implementing preventative measures, we aim to enhance the resilience of our web stack to ensure uninterrupted service for our users.
